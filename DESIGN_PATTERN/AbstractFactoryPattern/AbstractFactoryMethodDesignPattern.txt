**Abstract Factory Method Design Pattern**
	The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying 
	their concrete classes. 
	Think of it as a super factory—a factory of factories—that helps you maintain consistency across products that are meant to work together.

**Key Concepts**
	Component				Role
	AbstractFactory			Declares methods for creating abstract products
	ConcreteFactory			Implements creation methods for specific product variants
	AbstractProduct			Defines interfaces for product types
	ConcreteProduct			Implements the abstract product interfaces
	Client					Uses the abstract factory and products without knowing their concrete types

**Benefits**
	Ensures consistency among related objects
	Promotes loose coupling
	Makes it easy to switch families of products
	Supports Open/Closed Principle
