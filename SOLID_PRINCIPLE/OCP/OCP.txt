**OCP**
	The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) states that classes, modules or functions should be open for extension but closed for modification. 
	This means that you should be able to add new functionality without altering existing, working code. 

**Techniques to Implement OCP in C#**
	Interfaces and Abstract Classes: Define contracts that can be extended.
	Strategy Pattern: Encapsulate algorithms in interchangeable classes.
	Decorator Pattern: Add behavior dynamically without altering the original class.
	Dependency Injection: Inject dependencies to decouple and extend behavior.
